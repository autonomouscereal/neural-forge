## Activation-Quantile Transport Support

Added a structural fold lane for blank-target compression: `transport_support="quantile"`.

What changed:

- `hf-donor-project-init --transport-support quantile`
- `hf-xfamily-chain-anchor-compress --init-transport-support quantile`
- Activation transport can now seed target support axes from activation-weight strata instead of only clustered centroids or top-importance rows.
- For `importance` and `quantile` support, transport target masses are estimated from nearest-support activation load and used in both dense Sinkhorn transport and sparse balancing.
- Transport diagnostics now include `target_masses` so reports can prove whether support-energy balancing was active.

Why this matters:

- `importance` can over-focus on already-dominant channels.
- `centroid` can wash rare high-signal channels into cluster averages.
- `quantile` is intended as a middle lane: preserve low/mid/high activation strata before folding, then let transport merge donor axes into the target width.

Local validation:

- Focused xfamily transport/CLI tests: `3 passed, 3 skipped, 207 deselected`
- Full local suite: `140 passed, 125 skipped`

Current status:

- This is a fold/merge implementation improvement, not a proof of intelligence retention by itself.
- The next required evidence is a queued Qwen3-4B -> blank SmolLM2-135M quantile-support run with parent/before/after behavior and manual sample comparison.
