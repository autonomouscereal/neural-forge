# Wave 29: seal one ADDENDUM 6 verdict per graded child.  Every count here is a
# reading of the frozen dossier text, taken case by case; the per-case file is
# written first and the seal is refused if it disagrees with the totals.
#
# NOTE ON THIS FILE'S SYNTAX, because wave 23 lost text to it: a backtick inside
# a double-quoted bash string opens a command substitution and EATS everything to
# the next backtick.  Wave 23's sealed notes have holes in them for exactly that
# reason.  There is not one backtick anywhere below and there never will be.
#
# THE READING STANDARD.  Waves 19-24's, restated where it decides a case here.
#
#   A lane is CHARGED (degenerate) if it hits the generation cap, returns the
#   empty string, returns the PROMPT ITSELF, or carries the word-substitution
#   signature.  A CASE is held (Partial) if the lane's substantive asks are
#   answered in part and Useful if they are answered in full.  The two readings
#   are independent: a lane can carry a substitution and still answer, and wave
#   23's own V16X13 sealed a Partial on a lane it described as garbled.  What is
#   NOT allowed is to let a charged lane pass unnamed, which is why every child
#   below names its charged set explicitly.
#
# THE CALIBRATION THIS WAVE RAN BEFORE IT GRADED ANYTHING.  Wave 29 stacks off
# ARCH.V19 -- the 14/15 summit wave 27 sealed at 0.794570x -- and off ARCH.V18
# and ARCH.V20, the two 13/15 shoulders.  So the reader that produced the summit
# number is the reader that has to be shown to still be the same reader, and it
# is shown on THAT row: ARCH.V19's own wave-27 dossier was re-graded blind
# against the standard below before any wave-29 child was opened, and the parent
# baseline was re-read on the same pass.  Both reproduce the sealed record.  If
# either had not, nothing below would have been graded.
#
# THE COMPOSITION RULE, carried from wave 27 unchanged, because this wave grades
# more composed children than wave 27 did.  A composed child is graded on its OWN
# text and never against what its axes "should" cost: a reader who knows V19X13
# "ought" to read three below V19 will find three.  Every seal below was written
# from the READ- file before its arithmetic was computed.
#
# THE RULE THIS WAVE ADDS, for the bottom of the spectrum.  Wave 27 sealed the
# campaign's first 0/15 and observed that summarisation is the last lane to go.
# That observation is now a THING TO CHECK rather than a thing to expect: on
# every child under 0.60x below, the summarisation lane is read FIRST and its
# reading is written down before the other fifteen are opened, so the claim
# cannot be confirmed by a reader who already believes it.
#
# Carried calibrations, applied in BOTH directions:
#
# * writing-concise-email.  Wave 21 sealed W896's Partial as the ASK with no
#   email form and W896LS's MISS as the form with no ask, so THE ASK is the
#   discriminating criterion; wave 23 sealed V16 Useful for both asks inside a
#   salutation and a sign-off; wave 24 read the V16 family a MISS for inverting
#   Friday to Monday.  This wave adds one distinction it had to make eight times
#   and states it once: a child that carries all three named items and REQUESTS
#   the tracking number is Useful, and a child that carries all three and offers
#   to SUPPLY the tracking number has inverted the ask and is Partial.
# * instruction-three-actions.  Wave 23 sealed V16 Useful for three distinct
#   detailed actions DESPITE a forbidden preamble, so the criterion is the three
#   actions; a child whose three items are two items repeated is a miss.
# * planning-dependencies.  Wave 20 sealed a Partial for four of the five named
#   work items and wave 23 read a MISS for one of five, so the lane keys on the
#   ITEMS: five in six steps is Useful, four is Partial, three or fewer is a miss.
# * arithmetic-multi-step.  The PARENT gets this lane wrong (its sealed lane
#   boxes 3 kits per box and 94 left over), so a child that gets it right is
#   getting it right on its own.  A child that carries the chain correctly to the
#   division and then botches the remainder is Partial; a child that never forms
#   17 times 6 is a miss.
# * coding-deduplicate, which no child in 682 rows has held.  Wave 24 read V32's
#   attempt a miss and the reason is in the code: it accumulates into a SET and
#   returns it, so the one thing the lane asks for -- first-seen ORDER -- is the
#   one thing it does not do.  A child that accumulates into a LIST with append
#   and returns it has the algorithm right and is Partial even when the call
#   parentheses are dropped, because a dropped token is a dropped token and a
#   wrong container is a wrong answer.  Two children this wave clear that line.
# * creative-continuity, likewise never held.  Wave 24 read V32's 1,163-character
#   continuation a miss because it invented a new character and then contradicted
#   the scene.  A continuation that carries the fog, the keeper and the question
#   motif forward in coherent prose is Partial even if it renames the keeper;
#   a continuation that does neither is a miss.

# THE PROTECTION IS EXERCISED FOR THE FIFTH TIME, and it refused again.  Wave 32
# found its own cut had carried wave 31's nineteen seal calls forward with the
# substitution applied and every COUNT intact, added this file to HAND_EDIT and
# made the audit assert that the marker names THIS wave.  Wave 33 was the first
# cut where that fired and deleted fifteen calls by hand; wave 34 deleted six,
# wave 35 deleted eight, wave 36 deleted eight.  Wave 37 is the fifth: the file
# arrived VERBATIM carrying wave 36's marker and wave 36's SIX calls --
# W896CL1792, V12W896CL1792, V16W896CL1792, V9CL896G03, V9CL896G10 and
# V12CL896X13G03, counts intact -- and the cutter's audit refused on the marker
# before anything in this tree was run.  All six were deleted by hand before a
# single wave-37 call was written.  It also arrived sourcing LAST WAVE's env.sh
# and calling LAST WAVE's per-case and seal-verdict paths -- three path
# resolutions a verbatim copy cannot fix for itself, named here without their
# literal spellings so this file does not itself carry the identifier the
# cutter's audit forbids -- and those were retargeted by hand too.
#
# THE CALIBRATION THIS WAVE RUNS BEFORE IT GRADES ANYTHING is the parent lane,
# unchanged: the parent's own responses are re-read blind from this wave's first
# dossier against the standard at the top of this file and must reproduce the
# sealed reference of 5 Useful / 7 Partial / 3 misses = 12/15.  If it does not,
# nothing below is graded.  Tenth consecutive calibration.
