# One wave-6 (MX-J) composed child: solve every component in the recipe, install
# them in topological order, seal, and persist the composed tensors the frozen
# review reconstitutes the child from.
#
#   $1  cell id     e.g. COMP.MA.MXJ1
#   $2  mode        M-A | M-B
#   $3  recipe file
#   $4  gpu index   0 | 4  (both SM86 RTX 3090)
#
# Unchanged from waves 4 and 5, on purpose:
# * GPU pinned by PCI bus id in the shell AND re-checked by
#   --require-compute-architecture inside the process that seals the receipt.
# * Each run writes its own ledger shard; one serialized appender merges.
# * A cell id that is already sealed writes into a subdirectory; no sealed
#   receipt is ever opened for writing.
#
# New in wave 6, and both for the same reason -- the root filesystem has 7 GB
# free and must not be filled:
# * the composed children land under /mnt/ai_data/neural-forge-matrix/wave6.
# * the evidence-cache root is the /mnt wave6 root, whose already-built site
#   caches are symlinks to the wave-5 ones, so a reused site costs nothing and
#   a NEW site's 250-320 MB payload is written to the 1.8 TB share.
#
# The deployment is wave 5's `eb32153e`, deliberately and not for convenience:
# `git diff eb32153e 217458eb -- src experiments` is empty, so it is the exact
# technique surface that produced the survivors this wave assembles, and
# re-deploying could only introduce a difference.
