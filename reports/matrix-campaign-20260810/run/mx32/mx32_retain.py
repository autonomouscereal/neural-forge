"""Wave 32 retention -- REFUSES TO RUN until this wave's own manifest is written.

**A retention manifest is the one artifact in the tree that a blanket rename
makes ACTIVELY DANGEROUS, and this is the third wave to say so in this file.**
Wave 24's KEEP set named twelve children by tag -- ``MX24-V32``, ``MX24-V8`` and
so on -- and wave 25's rename turned those into ``MX25-*`` tags that either did
not exist or, worse, named different children; run as inherited it would have
deleted every checkpoint that wave built, because a wave-25 child whose tag is
not in a wave-24 KEEP set is, to this script, a duplicate.  Waves 25 and 26 each
replaced the inherited body with a refusal and wrote their KEEP set by hand.
Wave 32 does the same and copies neither: the tags below are written after this
wave's reviews are sealed, from the verdicts this wave actually recorded, and the
run is a DRY RUN first, always, with the delete list printed and read before
anything is unlinked.

Wave 32 also puts this file in `cut_wave32.py`'s HAND_EDIT set, so the tree cut
copied it VERBATIM -- last wave's nineteen tags arrived here still spelled for
last wave, which is exactly what makes the emptied mapping below a decision and
not an artifact of a substitution that happened to succeed.

**And it runs AFTER the package, not before.**  Wave 26 ran retention first and
deleted three children, taking their build receipts with them, because a build
receipt lives inside the child directory.  All three rebuilt byte-for-byte, but
the ordering is now a rule rather than a preference: ``package.sh`` first, then
``--plan``, then ``--apply``.

Usage::

    mx32_retain.py --plan            # print what would happen; never deletes
    mx32_retain.py --apply           # delete, after --plan has been read

#: Written after the reviews, never inherited.  Tag -> why this checkpoint is
#: worth its bytes.  An empty mapping is not a policy and the script says so.
#:
#: THE POLICY IS WRITTEN AFTER THE VERDICTS, so it is not written here yet, and
#: wave 30's policy paragraph was DELETED rather than renamed: it argued for a
#: specific set of last wave's rows, and inherited prose justifying a keep set is how
#: a retention decision gets made by the previous wave.  The standing rule the
#: next wave may argue with: keep the rows carrying a CLAIM no other artifact
#: re-derives, drop what one CPU pass rebuilds from a retained source, and state
#: the deviation whenever the count is not best-five.
